### In this release:

- ***Breaking changes***: requires `Glow Worm Luciferin` firmware (v5.5.8).
- **Capture enhancements.** Bias Light effect is now smoother than before with default settings. The change/transition between the brightness steps is now more linear.
- **Added an option to group LEDs.** The more LEDs you group, the more smooth is the Bias Light effect. Grouping LEDs afflicts precision.
- **Bottom row split adjustment is now possible.** You can now configure the gap size. (Closes #69).
- **Grabber area adjustment.** You can now choose the size of the grab area. (Closes #68).
- **LED corner skip.** The corners now have a horizontal and vertical adjustment feature for the gap. (Closes #67).
- **Color temperature correction no longer affect microcontroller's performance.** Microcontroller's performance has been improved by 40% when using color temperature correction.
- **Added more gamma steps** for a better fine tuning of the gamma.
- Fixed an issue that prevented screen capture when on some resolutions with some LEDs configurations. If you encountered this issue, no more black LEDs when capturing the screen.
- Audio functionality broke when changing the UI language, fixed.
